# A modern design for Anime News Network.

This layout is focused on improving readability and navigation.

- Daily Grids are 3 columns instead of the default 4 columns.
- The header now stays in view at all times to ensure easy navigation.
- The side highlights have been moved to the middle.
- Several minor changes to fit the theme.

**There are limitations to this stylesheet.**
- It does not work on table elements as the site uses images to generate its tables.
- The primary focus was on the homepage. Other pages on the site might not be displayed properly. I may update the stylesheet in the future so that they may work.
- It does not work on vertical screens(phones or vertical monitors).


## FAQ:

### What is this?
> This is a custom stylesheet for [Anime News Network](animenewsnetwork.com). It improves the websites layout and also changes the theme to dark mode.

### Why did you make this?
> I discovered the extension [Stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) recently and thought I could practice my CSS skills by redesigning [Anime News Network](animenewsnetwork.com) because I use that site quite often. I did not start from scratch. I used [ANN Dark Theme](https://uso.kkx.one/style/163165) by [slickboy](https://userstyles.world/user/slickboy) as the base. 

### Do you have experience in Web Development?
> I took one Web Development class in university and that was all. That class taught me HTML and CSS. That is the limit of my knowledge. At the moment, I do not know Javascript but I will learn it someday. 

### Will this custom CSS be updated?
> Maybe. Since I use the website quite often at the moment, if an update is needed, I will probably update it.

### I have encountered an error!
> As I have said, I am not an experienced developer. I suggest joining a few Subreddits or Discord servers as they may be of much more help to you.
